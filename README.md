### Case Study 1: Log Analysis and Reporting System
**Scenario:** A web hosting company needs to analyze server logs to generate reports on site traffic, errors, and other important metrics.

**Project Description:**
- **Objective:** Create a Shell script to analyze server logs and generate comprehensive reports.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - **Log Parsing:** Develop a script to parse log files (e.g., Apache or Nginx logs).
  - **Traffic Analysis:** Count and categorize page views, unique visitors, and popular pages.
  - **Error Detection:** Identify and report common errors (e.g., 404 errors, server errors).
  - **Report Generation:** Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports summarizing key metrics.
  - **Automation:** Schedule the script to run automatically and email reports to stakeholders.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Parsing and manipulating text files using Shell commands.
- Implementing conditional statements to categorize and analyze log data.
- Automating tasks through scheduling and reporting via Shell scripting.

### Case Study 2: File System Cleanup Automation
**Scenario:** A user needs to automate the cleanup of a directory by organizing files, archiving old files, and managing disk space efficiently.

**Project Description:**
- **Objective:** Create a Shell script to organize, archive, and manage files within a directory.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - **File Organization:** Categorize files by type (e.g., images, documents, scripts).
  - **Archiving Old Files:** Identify and compress files older than a specified date.
  - **Disk Space Management:** Monitor disk space and remove unnecessary or temporary files when approaching a threshold.
  - **Logging:** Maintain a log of actions performed by the script.
  - **User Interaction:** Optionally prompt the user for confirmation before executing critical actions.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Utilizing Shell commands to sort and categorize files based on their types.
- Implementing conditional statements to identify and compress old files.
- Monitoring disk space and managing files to prevent the system from filling up.
- Writing logs to track the actions performed by the script.
- Incorporating user interactions for safety and confirmation purposes.
