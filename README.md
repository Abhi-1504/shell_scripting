  #### Case Study 1: Log Analysis and Reporting System
  **Scenario:** A web hosting company needs to analyze server logs to generate reports on site traffic, errors, and other important metrics.
  
  **Project Description:**
  - **Objective:** Create a Bash script to analyze server logs and generate comprehensive reports.
  - **Key Tasks:**
    - **Log Parsing:** Develop a script to parse log files (e.g., Apache or Nginx logs).
    - **Traffic Analysis:** Count and categorize page views, unique visitors, and popular pages.
    - **Error Detection:** Identify and report common errors (e.g., 404 errors, server errors).
    - **Report Generation:** Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports summarizing key metrics.
    - **Automation:** Schedule the script to run automatically and email reports to stakeholders.
  
  **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Parsing and manipulating text files using Bash commands.
  - Implementing conditional statements to categorize and analyze log data.
  - Automating tasks through scheduling and reporting via Bash scripting.
  
  #### Case Study 2: File System Cleanup Automation

  **Scenario:** A user needs to automate the cleanup of a directory by organizing files, archiving old files, and managing disk space efficiently.
  
  **Project Description:**
  - **Objective:** Create a Bash script to organize, archive, and manage files within a directory.
  - **Key Tasks:**
    - **File Organization:** Categorize files by type (e.g., images, documents, scripts).
    - **Archiving Old Files:** Identify and compress files older than a specified date.
    - **Disk Space Management:** Monitor disk space and remove unnecessary or temporary files when approaching a threshold.
    - **Logging:** Maintain a log of actions performed by the script.
    - **User Interaction:** Optionally prompt the user for confirmation before executing critical actions.
  
  **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Utilizing Bash commands to sort and categorize files based on their types.
  - Implementing conditional statements to identify and compress old files.
  - Monitoring disk space and managing files to prevent the system from filling up.
  - Writing logs to track the actions performed by the script.
  - Incorporating user interactions for safety and confirmation purposes.
